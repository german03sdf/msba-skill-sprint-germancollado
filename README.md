# MSBA Skill Sprint — Credit Card Approval Prediction (Credit Risk)

This sprint is based on the public repository “Credit-card-approval-prediction-classification” by semasuka. The original project builds a machine learning model to predict credit card approval decisions using applicant data.

I selected this topic because credit approval modeling is directly aligned with banking, risk analytics, and credit risk modeling roles.
